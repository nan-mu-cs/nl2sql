OVERALL COMMENTS:
1. should be more sepecific on WHICH columns you are asking.
2. DO NOT ASK TOO TOO MANY QUESTIONS ANSWERED BY WHERE COL = ONE VALUE (e.g. "Tennis Club")!
3. SQL patterns could be more diverse. for example, use select count(*) too often.
   ADD more group by: this data has many ways to GROUP BY for example: how many clubs does each location have?/how many students does each club have? etc. then you can add more condition to these questions. e.g. how many female students does each club have?
   ADD more sum/avg/max etc. simple and complex
   ADD OR, != , LIKE
   ADD INTERSECT, EXCEPT, UNION, IN, NOT IN e.g. find the students who are in club 1 and club 2/who are in club1 but not club2
