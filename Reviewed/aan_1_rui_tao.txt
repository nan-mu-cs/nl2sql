OVERALL COMMENTS:
1. correct JOIN rules
2. too many questions that have to be answered by where col = ONE SPECIFIC VALUE. it is ok to have some values that make sense. But do not do it too much.
3. add more others:

Find the id and author of the papers whose title has the key word 'translation'.

Find the id and title of the papers that are never cited by others.

find the name of the affiliation whose address contains 'China' and publishs the most number of paper.

Find the number of papers published in different conferences each year.

Find the total number of papers for each affiliation.

Find the title of the papers that have more than 50 citations.

Find the number of authors who did not publish any paper that is cited more than 50 times.

Find the name of authors who published some paper on NAACL and ACL in the year 2009.

Find the name of authors who never published any paper on ACL.
